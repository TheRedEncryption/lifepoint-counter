## Why did I make this?
I dunno, I'm as unknowing as you are :/
## What will I add?
If you're lucky, anything at all :D

(fun fact, I made all this on a highly restrictive school chromebook (they blocked nearly 90% of the websites you'd usually use for any sort of development (they even blocked inspect element)))
